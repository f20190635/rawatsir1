<p>Last revision on January 15th 2016</p>
<p>The Personal Information Protection Policy of PBSC Urban Solutions Inc. (“PBSC”) is modeled after the principles set out in the national standard of Canada entitled “Model code for the protection of personal information” (CAN/CSA-Q830-96).</p>

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>DETAILS OF THE POLICY</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Accountability<br />PBSC has designated an individual or individuals accountable for PBSC’s compliance with the following Policy.</p>
<p>Accountability for PBSC’s compliance with this Policy rests with the designated individual(s), even though other individuals within PBSC may be responsible for the day-to-day collection and processing of Personal Information. Other individuals within PBSC may be delegated to act on behalf of the designated individual(s).</p>
<p>The identity of the individual(s) designated by PBSC to oversee PBSC’s compliance with this Policy will be made known upon request.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Purposes<br />The purposes for which Personal Information is collected will generally be identified by PBSC at or before the time the information is collected.</p>
<p>PBSC will document the purposes for which Personal Information is collected depending upon the way in which the information is collected, this can be done orally or in writing. An online application form or notes related thereto, for example, may give notice of the purposes.</p>
<p>Identifying the purposes for which Personal Information is collected at or before the time of collection allows PBSC to determine the information it needs to collect to fulfil these purposes. PBSC will collect only the information necessary for the purposes that have been identified.</p>
<p>The current purposes for which PBSC may collect your Personal Information include:</p>
<p>Providing, maintaining and improving PBSC services (the “Services”);<br />Allowing PBSC to perform internal operations in relation with its Services;<br />Sending or facilitating communications between PBSC and you in relation with the Services;<br />Tracking data related to the Services;<br />Personalizing and improving the Services.<br />When Personal Information that has been collected is to be used for a purpose not previously identified, the new purpose will be identified and documented prior to use. Unless the new purpose is required by law, the consent of the Individual will be requested before information can be used for that purpose.</p>
<p>PBSC will be able to explain to Individuals the purposes for which the information is being collected.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Consent<br />Your knowledge and consent are required for the collection, use or disclosure of Personal Information, except where inappropriate. (For example, legal, medical, or security reasons may make it impossible or impractical to seek consent.)</p>
<p>Consent to the collection, communication or use of Personal Information will be manifest, free and enlightened, and will be given for specific purposes. Such consent will be valid only for the length of time needed to achieve the purposes for which it was requested.</p>
<p>Typically, PBSC will seek consent for the use or disclosure of the information at or before the time of collection. In certain circumstances, consent with respect to use or disclosure may be sought after the information has been collected but before use (for example, when PBSC wants to use information for a purpose not previously identified).</p>
<p>To make the consent meaningful, the purposes for which the information will be used will be stated in such a manner that the Individual can reasonably understand how the information may be used or disclosed.</p>
<p>PBSC will not, as a condition of the supply of a product or service, require an Individual to consent to the collection, use or disclosure of information beyond that required to fulfil the purposes.</p>
<p>The form of the consent sought by PBSC may vary, depending upon the circumstances and the type of information. In determining the form of consent to use, PBSC will take into account the sensitivity of the information.</p>
<p>The way in which PBSC seeks consent may vary, depending on the circumstances and the type of information collected. PBSC will generally seek express consent when the information is likely to be considered sensitive. Implied consent may generally be appropriate when the information is less sensitive. Consent can also be given by an authorized representative (such as a legal guardian or a person having power of attorney). Consent will not be obtained through deception.</p>
<p>Individuals can give consent in many ways. For example:</p>
<p>an online application form may be used to seek consent, collect information and inform the Individual of the use that will be made of the information. By completing and sending the form, the Individual is giving consent to the collection and the specified uses;<br />a checkbox may be used to allow individuals to agree that their names and addresses be given to other organizations;<br />consent may be given orally when information is collected over the telephone; or<br />consent may be given at the time that Individuals use a product or service.<br />An individual may withdraw consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions and reasonable notice.</p>
<p>Consent to the communication of Personal Information from a third person may be given by the Individual to PBSC in order to collect the information from the third person.</p>
<p>PBSC will collect Personal Information only from the Individual, unless the latter consents to collection from third persons. However, PBSC may, without the consent of the Individual, collect Personal Information from a third person if the law so authorizes. It may also do so if it has a serious and legitimate reason and either of the following conditions is fulfilled:</p>
<p>the information is collected in the interest of the Individual and cannot be collected from him in due time;<br />collection from a third person is necessary to ensure the accuracy of the information.</p>
<p>Limited Collection<br />The collection of Personal Information will be limited to that which is necessary for the purposes identified by PBSC. Information will be collected by fair and lawful means.</p>
<p>PBSC will specify the type of information collected as part of their information-handling policies and practices. Personal Information collected may include, but is not limited to:</p>
<p>Name<br />Age<br />Email address<br />Weight<br />Height<br />Sex<br />Usage of the Services</p>
<p>PBSC may establish a file on an Individual.</p>
<p>PBSC may not refuse to respond to a request for goods or services or to a request relating to employment by reason of the applicant’s refusal to disclose Personal Information except where:</p>
<p>collection of that information is necessary for the conclusion or performance of a contract<br />collection of that information is authorized by law; or<br />there are reasonable grounds to believe that the request is not lawful.</p>
<p>LIMITED USE, DISCLOSURE AND RETENTION<br />Personal Information will not be kept, used or disclosed for purposes other than those for which it was collected, except your consent or as required by law. Personal Information will be retained only as long as necessary for the fulfilment of those purposes.</p>
<p>PBSC will develop guidelines and implement procedures with respect to the retention and destruction of Personal Information. These guidelines and procedures will include minimum and maximum retention periods. (PBSC may be subject to legislative requirements with respect to retention periods.)</p>
<p>PBSC will not communicate to a third person the Personal Information on an Individual unless the Individual consents thereto or such communication or use is provided for by law.</p>
<p>For instance, in the carrying on of its enterprise, PBSC’s authorized employees, mandataries or agents or any provider in to a contract with PBSC for work or services may have access to Personal Information without the consent of an Individual if the information is needed for the performance of their duties or the carrying out of their mandates or contracts.</p>
<p>PBSC may, without the consent of the Individual, communicate Personal Information contained in a file to an archival agency if the archival agency is a person whose object is the acquisition and preservation of documents for their general informational value and if the information is communicated as part of the transfer or deposit of the archives of PBSC.</p>
<p>Personal Information may also be communicated without the consent of the Individual for research purposes if the documents containing the information are not structured so as to allow retrieval by reference to an Individual’s name or identifying code or symbol and the information cannot be retrieved by means of such a reference.</p>
<p>Any person holding Personal Information on behalf of PBSC may refer to the latter every request for access or rectification received from an Individual to whom Personal Information relates.</p>
<p>Accuracy<br />Personal Information will be as accurate, complete and up-to-date as is necessary for the purposes for which it is to be used.</p>
<p>Personal Information that is used on an ongoing basis, including information that may be disclosed to third parties, will be generally accurate and up-to-date, unless limits to the requirement for accuracy are set out.</p>
<p>PBSC will not routinely update Personal Information, unless such a process is necessary to fulfil the purposes for which the information was collected.</p>
<p>The extent to which Personal Information will be accurate, complete and up-to-date will depend upon input (i) from the Individual or (ii) resulting from data generated by the Individual using PBSC products or services, and the use of the information, taking into account the interests of the Individual.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Safeguards<br />Personal Information will be protected by security safeguards appropriate to the sensitivity of the information.</p>
<p>PBSC will take the security measures necessary to ensure the protection of the Personal Information collected, used, communicated, kept or destroyed and that are reasonable given the sensitivity of the information, the purposes for which it is to be used, the quantity and distribution of the information and the medium on which it is stored.</p>
<p>The security safeguards of PBSC will protect Personal Information against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.</p>
<p>The nature of the safeguards will vary depending on the sensitivity of the information that has been collected, the amount, distribution and format of the information and the method of storage.</p>
<p>The methods of protection will include:</p>
<p>physical measures (such as restricted access to offices);<br />organizational measures (such as security clearances); and<br />technological measures (such as the use of passwords).<br />PBSC will make its employees aware of the importance of maintaining the confidentiality of Personal Information, and care will be used in the disposal or destruction of Personal Information, to prevent unauthorized parties from gaining access to the information.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Openness<br />PBSC will make readily available to you specific information about its policies and practices relating to the management of Personal Information.</p>
<p>PBSC is open about its policies and practices with respect to the management of Personal Information. Individuals will be able to acquire information about PBSC’s policies and practices without unreasonable effort. This information will be made available in a form that is generally understandable.</p>
<p>The information made available includes:</p>
<p>the name or title and the address, of the person who is accountable for PBSC’s policies and practices and to whom complaints or inquiries can be forwarded;<br />the means of gaining access to Personal Information held by PBSC;<br />a description of the type of Personal Information held by PBSC, including a general account of its use; and<br />what Personal Information is made available to related organizations (e.g. affiliates such as subsidiaries and parent organizations).<br />PBSC may make information on its policies and practices regarding Personal Information Protection available in a variety of ways. The method chosen depends on the nature of its business and other considerations.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Individual Access<br />Upon request, an Individual will be informed of the existence, use and disclosure of his or her Personal Information and will generally be given access to that information. An Individual will be able to challenge the accuracy and completeness of the information and have it amended as appropriate.</p>
<p>Upon request, PBSC will inform an Individual whether or not PBSC holds Personal Information about the Individual and may indicate the source of this information. PBSC will generally allow the Individual access to this information. An individual may be required to provide sufficient information to permit PBSC to provide an account of the existence, use and disclosure of Personal Information.</p>
<p>An individual is entitled to obtain that any Personal Information collected otherwise than according to law be deleted.</p>
<p>No request for access, rectification or deletion may be considered unless it is made in writing by an Individual who proves that he is the person concerned (or the representative, heir or successor of that person, the liquidator of the succession, a beneficiary of life insurance or of a death benefit or the person having parental authority even if the minor child is dead).</p>
<p>PBSC, when holding a file that is the subject of a request for access, rectification or deletion by an Individual, will respond to that request within a reasonable time after receipt of the request. The requested information will be provided or made available in a form that is generally understandable. (For example, if PBSC uses abbreviations or codes to record information, an explanation will be provided.)</p>
<p>In certain situations, PBSC may not be able to provide access to all the Personal Information it holds about an Individual. Exceptions to the access requirement are meant to be limited and specific. The reasons for denying access will be provided to the Individual upon request.</p>
<p>Exceptions may include information that is prohibitively costly to provide, information that contains references to other individuals, information that cannot be disclosed for legal, security or commercial proprietary reasons and information that is subject to solicitor-client or litigation privilege.</p>
<p>PBSC may refuse to communicate Personal Information to the Individual it concerns where disclosure of the information would be likely to hinder an inquiry the purpose of which is the prevention, detection or repression of crime or statutory offences.</p>
<p>PBSC will refuse to give communication of Personal Information to an Individual to whom it relates where (i) disclosure would be likely to reveal Personal Information about a third person or the existence of Personal Information and (ii) the disclosure may seriously harm that third person, unless the latter consents to the communication of the information or in the case of an emergency that threatens the life, health or safety of the Individual.</p>
<p>A reasonable charge may be required from an Individual requesting the transcription, reproduction or transmission of Personal Information.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Challenging Compliance<br />An Individual may address a challenge concerning compliance with this Policy to the designated individual or individuals accountable for PBSC’s compliance.</p>
<p>PBSC has put procedures in place to receive and respond to complaints or inquiries about their policies and practices relating to the handling of Personal Information. The complaint procedures will be easily accessible and simple to use.</p>
<p>PBSC will inform individuals who make inquiries or lodge complaints of the existence of relevant complaint procedures.</p>
<p>PBSC will investigate all complaints. If a complaint is found to be justified, PBSC will take appropriate measures, including, if necessary, amending its policies and practices.</p>
<p>When a challenge is not resolved to the satisfaction of the Individual, the substance of the unresolved challenge will be recorded by PBSC.</p>
